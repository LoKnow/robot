# LoKnow Robot Code Challenge

Welcome the challengeâ€”we hope it's fun!

Clone this existing Django app:

https://github.com/LoKnow/robot

Modify it so that it does these things:
1. Saves sets of instructions about a robot's movement entered by a user
    - Instructions can be 'up', 'down', 'left', or 'right', with a unit of distance.

    For example, a set of instructions could be:
    - UP 5
    - LEFT 3
    - DOWN 2
    - RIGHT 1

2. Displays the list of saved instruction sets

3. Displays a selected instruction set, along with statistics:
  - Statistics required are:
    1. Number of instructions in the instruction set
       - Example from instructions above: 4 instructions
    2. Absolute distance travelled from robot's original position (rounded to 1 decimal place)
       - Example from instructions above: 3.6

Please update the README with any additional steps required to run the updated app.

Your code will be evaluated primarily on these criteria:

1) Does it meet the requirements?
2) Is the code well organized and easy to understand?
3) Is the app easy to install and run?

Bonus points:
- Demonstrated comfort with Python & Django
- Validation
- Tests
